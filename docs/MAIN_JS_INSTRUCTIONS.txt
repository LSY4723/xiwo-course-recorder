Insert at top near other requires/imports:

const { initFfmpegIpc } = require('./src/utils/ffmpeg-ipc');

and after the BrowserWindow (mainWindow) has been created and ipcMain is available, add:

initFfmpegIpc(ipcMain, mainWindow);

If main.js is absent, create a file with the minimal snippet that requires electron, creates a BrowserWindow and calls initFfmpegIpc. Otherwise, only modify main.js as described above.
